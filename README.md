## Cache Simulator

This is a simulation of CPU cache memory also know as cache which is a chip-based feature of a computer that lets the user access information more quickly than if they were to access it from the computerâ€™s main hard drive.

This simulator models 7 different cache configurations and prints out the number of hits and the hit rate to the screen.

NB: It simulates the following cache configurations using LRU (Least Recently Used), which is a page replacement algorithm used for virtual memory management optimization, when appropriate and the cache is byte addressable:

2KB, direct mapped, 1-word blocks  
2KB, direct mapped, 2-word blocks  
2KB, direct mapped, 4-word blocks  
2KB, 2-way set associative, 1-word blocks  
2KB, 4-way set associative, 1-word blocks  
2KB, 4-way set associative, 4-word blocks  
4KB, direct mapped, 1-word blocks
