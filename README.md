It simulates the following cache configurations (using LRU when appropriate and the cache is byte addressable):

2KB, direct mapped, 1-word blocks
2KB, direct mapped, 2-word blocks
2KB, direct mapped, 4-word blocks
2KB, 2-way set associative, 1-word blocks
2KB, 4-way set associative, 1-word blocks
2KB, 4-way set associative, 4-word blocks
4KB, direct mapped, 1-word blocks
